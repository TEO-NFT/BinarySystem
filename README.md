#  The Binary System

# 🔎 What's Binary System

- Is a numeric system that uses only two digits 

- 0️⃣1️⃣

- The binary system is based on powers of two

- Each binary digit is called a bit

# 🔎 Byte & Bit

- Each 0️⃣ & 1️⃣ is a Bit
- The set of 8 bits becomes a byte

# 💡 Binary systems applications

## 🖥️ The binary system is fundamental in electronics and computing.

# 💻 Computers and digital systems

 - Computers and other digital systems use the binary system to store and process information.

# ⚡ Logic circuits

 - Electronic circuits use electrical signals in the form of 0's and 1's to represent information and perform logical operations.

# 📊 Data representation

 - In computing, information is represented and stored in binary form. Characters, numbers, images, sounds and any other type of data are converted into bit sequences before being processed or stored.

# 🔒 Cryptography

 - Cryptography, the study of encryption and decryption techniques, also uses the binary system.
 - Cryptographic algorithms work with logical operations and bit manipulation to encrypt and decrypt data.

# 📶 Computer networks
 - Computer networks use the binary system to represent and transmit data.
 - The data is divided into binary packets and sent over cables, radio waves or fiber optics in the form of digital signals.
